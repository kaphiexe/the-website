Please be quiet,
Dim the sounds in my mind.

I don’t read around my friends during Wednesday reading because I claim that I won’t fall for that propaganda, I won’t let Steve get his way.
But the truth is I would love some time to read, any day. 
I read out loud. 
I read with emotion.
Which is why I can’t read with anyone around. 
I need sound.
Sometimes the words get jumbled up. 
I don’t care; it makes sense to me.
That’s really all that words are supposed to be.

Please stop the chanting. 
Please stop the squeal. 
Please let me heal. 

When I am alone, I talk to myself. 
Not just to myself, I talk to my friends as well.
Some of my friends are real, and some are fake. 
Which is why I find reality hard to grasp.
I can still taste their flavours. 
Sour, salty, sweet, or heat.
I found out that most people don’t have flavours.
I thought we did just no one talked about it, that much.
It’s subtle anyways so I don’t really care one bit. 

I am not crazy. I don’t think that at all.
Even if I say that I am not small. 
My words don’t make much sense. 
Two hours of my life so gone, I wonder what I’ll do next wrong. 

I feel very safe with my life right now.
I have a good relationship with food. 
I don’t overwork myself.
I enjoy the little things in life.
I wake up every morning and say “Life is too beautiful to not smile everyday.”
And so I do.
I smile everyday. 

Everyone is lying to me.
So I don’t believe anyone, but myself, anymore.
I don’t plan on keeping score.

When I go on my walks, 
me and my friends, we talk.
I went to tell someone about it, but then I realised the old lady I made friends with was in my head.
I had a nice time talking to her, I hope she did as well. 
I won’t be confined to a clock or a bell. 
Just like that I won't be confined to this reality,
my mind can take me some place else. 

I wonder what was evil this morning…
Why did I wake up sweating with my heart racing? 
That happens a lot, so it's not unordinary.
But, why the evil chants? Is it me? Am I evil? 

These grapes that I munch have a very nice crunch.

            # 04/09/2025

Today, I ate a slice of toast,
It had cheese, garlic and herbs. 
Nothing fancy like a roast.
“I enjoy bread more than toast” is what I thought in my head.
But, today brioche tickled my taste buds instead.

Today, I watched a movie with my parents.
I didn't like it much, cops who searched without warrents.
But, I like spending time with those who care, and hold me dear.

Life does not have to be difficult.
I smile every day, some are weirded out and wonder if I am in some strange cult.
Everyone thinks I am insane.
But, everyone thinks the same.

Life is a prison, or so I thought.
Nothing I say makes any sense.
But, it's all I got. 
Lost ramblings of a weird girl who got unfortunately found,
Which is why I scream but never make a sound.

For you,
I fell like rain drops.
Slowly going deeper, and deeper,
until I was floating in the oceans locked behind your eyes.
With every word, the currents grew stronger.
Please talk about disco elysium a bit longer. 
Long enough for me to drown in the beauty of your soul.
The waves have come like a tsunami and taken me whole.
          </div>
          <div class="poem">
            # 18/08/2025

I'm not sugar.
I do not dissolve in water
My molecules don't intertwine and confine,
they spill out like poison.

I am a teabag.
Leave me to boil,
I won't disintegrate without some turmoil.
Leave me to drown,
Soak in and intrude,
my head will pound, after the interlude.

My flavour and essence leak,
Slowly revealing that I am obsolete.
I hope they know this isn't my peak.

My tea leaves hold stories,
Some of which are a bit gory.
Which is what makes them sour and sweet,
all they need is a bit of heat.
My tea is not your average cup of tea.
Some will say it is revolting
Been touched by far more than ever supposed to be,
Unhygienic.
It should be insulting,
But I find it cathartic.
My tea is mine, and mine alone
With all the troubles that are deep sown.

My tea doesn't need sugar, honey, or any sweetening splice.
I serve it pure and raw.
My tea does not have to be nice.

I will never be tender nor sweet.
I will always be a teabag.
Not meant to be opened to taste my soul,
Soak me in life,
And soon I'll let you have me whole.

Today, I saw a dead crow
It made me question what I know

I was walking up and down the road
first, I saw one peck at the ground 
Thump thump thump
Out came a worm after the bump

I went on a second date.
Usually, I don't make it to this stage
But she was too enchanting for me not to engage 

When we walk together (holding hands omg) we're always at the same pace
She keeps asking me if I'm okay
Right after she kisses my face
Jittery from joy not fear 
They give me warm hugs, like a teddy bear

I like standing extra close, when we hold books open together in the library 
And listening to you and all your joys of literary 
They keep asking if I'm bored 
if only they knew that their voice swishes in my mind like a beautiful wave
oh my days 

They call me Aphrodite 
Goddess of love, beauty, and desire
All I know is that I'm addicted to her like chai tea (dont cancel me i had to add the tea for rhyming)

I think well be going on a couple more dates.
Hopefully a lot.

I'm full yet starving 
With every little cut, I can feel myself dying 
Because I always taught myself to never ask for too much
So please, don't let me skip lunch

I went on a first date
I didnt want her to wait 
i was so nervous, i almost didn't show
But there was still so much i wanted to know
When i saw them there, in their breathtaking blue blazer 
With her flowy red hair 
I felt like a stargazer.

She was just like me 
Nervous, unsure, akward
Standing stiff like a tree 
With every little pun, i could feel my heart get reeled further away 
Their cute smile could make my day.

I had a crush on them from the start
Shes pretty and abstract, like art 
To be admired and understood 
I'd give her the world, if I could 

Walking through the library 
I was happy as i could ever be
Their warm palms gave a home to my heart
And i really hope that we never part

I went on a first date
I won't lie, i was scared 
But she made sure i let go of all that i feared

So much so, that we went on a second date.

Every day, the moon dies

I’m sixteen and this is not a fucking day dream
I'm falling behind  
This world needs empathy of some kind
Im working so hard but my qualities can't seem to redeem  
Even if I keep it on the down-low

Trauma response.

I have a plastic bag over my head and its suffocating.
I put it there to protect me from the world, it felt relieving 
Well it did, for a little bit 
But now, I want to cut a snip
So I can finally breath.

My plastic bag is blind 
It protects me from everything, good or bad it doesn't mind 

The wrinkles shrivel in with every breath I take 

I can't even tell if this is real or fake
Everyday feels like my last 
Reality seems like a cruel joke my mind has cast
Please let me out of my plastic bag world
I want to see my existence when its not swirrled
I don't need this plastic bag to protect me
This is not the way its ment to be
Its sees my happiness as a risk
Now that I know that, i want to be free like a whisk

I know you're wrong 
And I know everyone wants to protect me
But I don't know why I want just to let you be 
fuck it, your jokes aren't funny
Why do you treat me like some dumb kind of bunny 
I really should hate you
I shouldn't let you do what you do

I rise, I ache, and I think I’m healing
For once, I could be a pomegranate worth peeling

My pomegranate heart
messy, fucked up, and far from art
instead of some grand gesture
I need patience and a lot of love 
peel me seed by seed 
like my heart, your fingers will bleed. 
scattering and spilling my promises 
sticky and raw, 
try pry me open, I’ll explode 
I'll cry, but it might sound like an ode
filled of music and blood. 
my ruby rhinestones will come out like a flood
because inside my heart a garden resides 
But it'll take a lot to get inside.

Please peal my pomegranate heart 
let my heart breathe and cry

Maybe in another life I boy
If I was a boy, maybe I would be the one you had a crush on
the one who took care of all his friends
The one who never pretends 
If I was a boy, I wouldn’t laugh at bad jokes
I would look them in the eyes and tell them to cope
If I was a boy, I would treat everyone with respect
and I would never become a man who turns into a monster
when does a man become a monster?

Rotten, sticky fruit.
If I had been more careful, I could've put them in a jar and pickled them
They could have been enjoyed, rather than kicking up phlegm.
Now, the fruit flies rally about
Buzz buzz buzz
All I can do is sit around and pout. 
Oh, how I had plans for my fruit
Jam, sweets, and just about anything neat 
I couldn't decide
Now I'm stuck with
Rotten, sticky fruit.

Every morning, I regret waking up
But I doubt anyone gives a fuck
I used to have a garden in my heart
A garden for you, and a garden for me
Where we could rest peacefully.

Fall is long gone
But my pain goes on
Trees are still bare
My fruit are still sour
The flowers are yet to bloom 
A garden stuck in time.

I want to write something
But I have no inspiration
I am left in exasperation 
I keep thinking in hopes of nothing
Blank, blank, blank
This poem could not be any more frank
Typing away on my keys
Life seems to be 2D 
Listening to my chemical romance
hoping I can get another chance

            # inspired by “She walks in Beauty” by George Gordon, Lord Byron

Fogged up, tearing glass
                      open it a little, let in some air
Tales of artists, flowers, and love entangled in the curtains 
One shade the more, one ray the less,
when time seemed to stop, 
                      but there was never enough
Close the window. 
Close the window, you don’t know better. 
She walks in beauty, like a melody 
                      for music is the sound of love 
                      and all her words are an odyssey
Her eyes grip her dreams 
                      while her tears rot in her soul
She walks in beauty, locked up in her tower
A heart whose love is in innocent.
Close the window.
no matter how beautiful it is, the world will hurt you
or…
you could throw it wide open,
                    dive headfirst into the ocean  
drowning
                  deeper,
                                   deeper,
                                                    deeper. 
let beauty carve her with solace and sorrow
                     feel it all, the paralyzing shock 
not as far-away gazer
trapped behind a mirror
But as a red, red rose, 
                    whose thorns are ready to bleed, for something real.
Because seeing is not the same as living
Yearning behind some window,
                    is a slow kind of dying.

Maybe it's me.
Maybe it's my fault
It must be what I wear
or how I do up my hair 
It must be the way I act, like I don’t care
Thats the only way it could be
Never the way he sees
It must be the colour of my skin
or something else, only I could sin
Never him
Maybe it's me. 
It must be my fault
For having pages open, for him to tear out
For being a girl, he could assault 
It must be the way I talk
It must be the way I walk
I must be asking for it
Even if I didn’t like it one bit.

When the night whispers my name I look around

            # 17/02/2025

Tears fall down 
One at a time
Till my eyes and red are bound
Till my hair is damp
Till I smell salty and my voice croaks
I scream for no one to hear me
Am I even real?
If no one sees my pains or sorrows
Did it even happen?
Oh well, I won't even remember this tomorrow 
Silly little girl
She sees rain clouds and calls for storms
Splashes in a puddle and screams that she drowned 
From fear, rage forms
And now it's the final count down
How much more can she take?
Is she weak for thinking all this is far too much? 
Is she dramatic?
Is she ungrateful?
Even after all she's seen that's traumatic.

You are the sweetest 
                            soul 
                           I have ever seen. 

You’re all my 
               favourite songs
               trapped in one person 
I hope we have one of those friendships
where anything can happen
                and nothing will change 
We’re the sun
               and the moon
We’re bacon 
               and eggs
If we were stars, we’d
twinkle and winkle 
                             at each other
and the silly little earthlings will call it science
so, there's a garden in my heart,
where you can sleep safely
where you can put everything
that weighs you
                                    down.
I just can’t say enough
how much I appreciate 
you being in the world
They say friends are chosen family
but what we have runs so much deeper 
                                               than blood
You make me feel like I am home again.

Laying here in my pathetic existence
I try to doze off into sleep
But my body only shows resistance 
The only thoughts that pacify my mind
Is fantasies of suicide 
The type that make me cry
I don't want to think this way
But these ideas occupy my mind
I wish they would go away

Some days I regret waking up
Lost in my mind 
I'm often left confined 

I used to cry everyday
But now i can't find any emotion to display
Like floating through existence 
Without a thought of resistance

It's dangerous here
If you stare at the stars long enough, you’ll start thinking you can grab one
and you get this feeling like all your dreams will come true

Here, in the city, the sky is cloudy
The stars are dim, like the fake ones in a planetary 
I miss the stars
My only friends 
But I’ll cut my hands off before I ever reach for you again

But, ever since my house burnt down, I've had a better view of the hypnotic night sky 
The stars hear me laugh
The stars hear me cry
I wonder if they heard me die

Life is very long.
And this is how the world ends

She had fresh picked plums for cheeks, and smelled just as sweet. 
There was this look on her face that made me think “This girl has it all.” From her crazy punk hair, to intimidating eyeliner, it was us living in her world.
Her eyes were an ocean, vast and much to discover. Her skin was a poem, freeing the tears that rot in her soul. 
She's inlove with the world.

"How Do You Run from What's Inside Your Head?"

The monsters were never under my bed
They were all in my head
The girl who was afraid to be
She wished just to be free
To say all that should be said
Oh, how it all stayed in her head
Do I dare? Do I dare?
Resigned to inaction 
All with abstraction 
Trapped in her own mind
If only she could rewind
She would dare
To take up space
To show her face
To even disgrace
I dare, I dare
No monster I fear, 
for no monsters I see
All this time the monsters were me.

The rain is speaking quietly 
“You can sleep now” she whispers 
I can smile, ever so slightly 
She wants me to take all she has done lightly
She gives life, she keeps water flowing 
Works and works, with no fruits 
She left all she ever loved, and always substitutes
Her cries are lost in thunder
I am left to wonder 
How does she go on like this? 
Lost in the abyss
Everything that is wrong, I couldn't even list
Yet, she drowns her plants living 
Because she will never know when to stop giving.

            # In a minute there is time

I forever find myself drowning.
All till my head is pounding
There will be time for you, time for me
This is my sublime, my prime
You who I neglect, my biggest regret
The further I run
I am never done
As far as I look, I cannot see the sun

In a minute there is time
Treated as if it were worth a dime
A hundred visions
All lost in indecisions

There will be time for our hands to meet
To do all the things that are neat
There will be time to say all the things that should be said
Or maybe it should all stay in my head

Hours will pass by in disguise
I will cause my very own demise
The very thing I used to dread
I, now, crave instead
Time past, no time present
I hear the clock chime
In a minute there is time
Yet, no time for you, no time for me.
